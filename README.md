# PV260 Lab - Code smells, Refactoring, Clean Code

## Geometric shapes example
The example consists of the following two projects, `shapes-procedural` and `shapes-polymorphic`. 
Both contain a simple geometric shapes implementation and a test class (GeometryTest), although each of these projects 
designed the shape classes using a different approach.

### Your task:
- In your group, select one of the projects, either `shapes-procedural`, or `shapes-polymorphic`.
- Take a look at the implementation and run the `GeometryTest` class to make sure the project is buildable and the tests 
passing.
- Add a new data structure, `Circle` into the `shapes` package, along with a test for its area calculation.
- Add a new operation, `perimeter` calculation, to all the geometric shape classes, along with corresponding tests.

The goal of this exercise is to experience the consequences of choosing a different design - therefore, 
after you are done, do the same task with the other project (`procedural` x `polymorphic`).

### Think about the differences in both projects:
- What was easier or harder with the procedural approach?
- What was easier or harder with the polymorphic approach?
